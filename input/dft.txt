Implement a Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) function that processes a sequence of 256 sampled signals (N = 256) and computes their frequency domain representation.

The function should take two input/output arrays:

sample_real[N]: the real part of the input samples; will be overwritten with the real part of the DFT output.

sample_img[N]: the imaginary part of the input samples (initially all zeros if the input signal is purely real); will be overwritten with the imaginary part of the DFT output.

Use standard math functions sin() and cos() from the <math.h> library.

The function prototype:

```cpp
void dft(double sample_real[N], double sample_imag[N])
```
